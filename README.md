# Random-search
Implement Random search algorithm. Implementation done in Python.

Your algorithm must have these inputs:
Test function
Input domain of the test function
Dimension size
Number of iterations

The algorithm must provide at the output:
Best found value of objective function f(x)
The value of x of the best found f(x)
Convergence graph of the development of the f(x)
